        <i>
          An interface many of us use every day, the keyboard is an input device
          for personal computers and laptops. 
          <br/>
          It allows users to type digital characters
          into a computer system to write words and invoke commands,
          <br/>
          for the purposes of
          editing documents, searching the internet, and more.

        <h2><span class="text-gradient">Interview Process</span></h2>
        <p>
          I observed and interviewed three individuals using this keyboard to learn about
          their experience using it. I principally wanted to focus on three areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comfort of use</li>
          <li>Recognizability of layout</li>
          <li>Familiarity with shortcut commands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the first metric, I primarily paid attention to how the users sat, and how they
          positioned their arms and hands while typing. For the second and third, I observed
          their behaviour following prompts and exercises. The observation period consisted of
          three steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Perform an online typing test</li>
          <li>Copying and pasting text</li>
          <li>
            Holding down each of <pre>fn</pre>, <pre>control</pre>, <pre>option</pre>, and
            <pre>command</pre> keys, and pressing different regular characters
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2><span class="text-gradient">Observations</span></h2>
        <div class="bottom-margin">
          <b>User 1:</b> User appeared to be accustomed to layout of character keys, and did
          not need to look at the keyboard when typing in the online test. 73 WPM. User attempted
          to copy and paste with the control key, instead of the command key.
        </div>
        <div class="bottom-margin">
          <b>User 2:</b> User was comfortable with the Mac keyboard, but frequently looked down at
          the keys during the typing test. 40 WPM. User correctly used command key to copy and paste
          on first attempt. Appeared to be caught off-guard by some of the more obscure functions, like <pre>option+h</pre>.
        </div>
        <div>
          <b>User 3:</b> User performed typing test with relative ease. 75 WPM. User had good working
          knowledge of different commands, for instance: the difference between <pre>command+w</pre> 
          and <pre>command+q</pre>. Position of arms looked unnatural/uncomfortable.

        <h2><span class="text-gradient">Interview Questions</span></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Did you find this keyboard to be comfortable to type on?</li>
          <li>How does the feeling of pressing keys compare to keyboards you're used to?</li>
          <li>Is the compressed keyboard layout comfortable for your hands?</li>
          <li>Do you find yourself wishing that any of the keys were larger, smaller, or placed in different locations?</li>
          <li>Is the copy + paste motion comfortable? What fingers do you use to accomplish this task?</li>
          <li>Do you regularly use MacBook keyboards? If not, do you use other keyboards, and what system are they for?</li>
          <li>Do you find that the modifier keys have consistent behaviors and functions?</li>
          <li>What commands were you already familiar with?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2><span class="text-gradient">Summary</span></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Users who primarily use Windows found the copying and pasting control to be awkward, and the commands unintuitive and poorly grouped.</li>
        <li>Users who primarily use Mac were comfortable with copying and pasting, but were surprised by some of the command functions.</li>
        <li>Overall, the keyboard was thought to be comfortable to type on, but some may have preferred the keys to have a bit more travel.</li>
        <li>Users agreed that there were too many modifier keys (`fn`, `control`, `option`, and `command`) with obscure functionality.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2><span class="text-gradient">Personas</span></h2>
        <p>
          Using the information garnered by the interview and observation process, I aggregated users'
          experiences into two personas, roughly representing the main user groups of this product.
